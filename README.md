This package includes the following plugins:
- A block with a button taking you to the edu-sharing workspace and the edu-sharing search engine.

It offers your users the following features:
  - content licenses (creative commons)
  - freely configurable folder structures
  - meta-data editing and inheritance
  - version management

- The edu-sharing activity plugin which adds a new option to the activities/resource menu. Using the edu-sharing resource allows you to either pick content from the repository or upload it to a folder of the repository. You may pick which version of the content you would like to provide in the course (always the latest vs. the version you just picked).
- The edu-sharing editor plug in to add the option to embed all kinds of edu-sharing content to all WYSIWYG fields. The new button will open the edu-sharing search engine and let you pick an item embed. Audio and video-files will be embedded with a player. Documents will be represented by a link. You may pick which version of the content you would like to provide in the course (always the latest vs. the version you just picked).
